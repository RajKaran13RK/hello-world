How the naming/numbering of the versions are done.
Semantic numbering – Three-digit numbering technique based on Major.Minor.Patch
Date-of-release – The software version number is the date of the release. For example, 20.06 (June 2020)
    Major version changes are related to incompatible API changes.
    Minor version changes are related to adding new functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
    Patch version changes are related to bug fixes which are also backward compatible.
